    Fontend:-
        1-I Have created Userfriendly interface. User can Place an order with specific details of product(like product name,Quantity,Price)
        2-OnOrdering the product ,
            Order Response: will show the orderId,productName,quantity,price,discount,finalAmount,timestamp.

            This component will update the total amount automatically , when addition of placing orders. So that it is easy to find the total revenue of products buying product.
        
    Backend:-
        1- I have created server.js
            which accepts productName, quantity, price on placing order .Each order should have a unique ID and timestamp.
        2- Dynamic Logic:
            -If the total order amount (quantity × price) exceeds ₹10,000, apply a 10% discount.
            -If the order includes more than 5 items, apply an additional ₹500 flat discount.
            -The discounts reflect in the stored order data and the Order Summary API response.
        3-No negative quantities or prices are allowed
        4-Used an in-memory database (e.g., an array) for storing order data.
        5-Used Javascript/ Typescript along with Express.js
        6-The APIs are functional and testable using tools like Postman or cURL.
